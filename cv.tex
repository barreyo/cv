\section*{Experience}

\datedsubsection{Software Engineer / AI Researcher, Bracket Computing}{Dec 2017 - May 2018}

\begin{itemize}[label={\tiny\raisebox{1ex}{\textbullet}}]
  \item {Reinforcement Learning research focused on autonomous cyber-threat response using Bayesian Attack Graphs formulated as a Partially Observable
  Markov Decision Process (POMDP)}
  \item {Developed FreeBSD kernel code in C, and user-space Python services that
  communicated with a Kubernetes-managed control plane written in Go, to
  collect and process large amounts of telemetry data.}
  \item {Improved and debugged micro-services implemented in Go and managed in Kubernetes}
  \item {Published an open source OpenAI environment for
  threat defense research \\
  (\href{https://github.com/barreyo/gym-threat}{github.com/barreyo/gym-threat}})
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{Software Engineering Intern, Bracket computing}{Jun 2015 - Jun 2016}

\begin{itemize}[label={\tiny\raisebox{1ex}{\textbullet}}]
  \item {Designed and implemented the build and CI pipeline using Docker and Jenkins. Which simplified maintenance and improved consistency.}
  \item {Built a testing framework in Python based on PyTest; that made it easy
  to write generic tests across AWS, GCE and on-premise VMWare. The framework
  was used by the whole organization of about 30 engineers.}
  \item {Wrote end-to-end integration and performance tests}
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{Software Engineer, Freelance}{Apr 2015 - Jul 2015}

\begin{itemize}[label={\tiny\raisebox{1ex}{\textbullet}}]
  \item {Designed and developed the embedded software for a low-cost road sign
  that shows the current speed of passing vehicles, bikers and pedestrians
  using radar technology}
  \item {Mocked the hardware features of the custom-designed hardware to create
  regression tests}
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{Vice Business Area Manager, Chalmers Teknologkonsulter}{Jan 2014 - Jun 2014}

\begin{itemize}[label={\tiny\raisebox{1ex}{\textbullet}}]
  \item {Managed 18 software engineers in sales and project work that ranged
  from mobile app development to embedded systems}
  \item {Increased the time consultants were assigned to billable projects,
  which lead to an increased business area revenue by 80\%}
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{Software Engineer Consultant, Chalmers Teknologkonsulter}{Sep 2013 - Feb 2015}

\begin{itemize}[label={\tiny\raisebox{1ex}{\textbullet}}]
  \item {Embedded development in C on custom-designed BLE hardware}
  \item {Developed core technology, OTA updates over Bluetooth, charging
  and battery management}
  \item {Developed an Android app to debug Bluetooth connections}
\end{itemize}
